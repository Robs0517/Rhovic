## Chosen SDG

For our portfolio, we have collectively chosen **SDG 4: Quality Education** as the primary Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). We believe that education is one of the most powerful tools for improving lives and shaping a better future for all. 

Through our projects, we aim to make education more accessible, especially for underserved communities, and to bridge the digital divide by providing free resources and learning opportunities. Each member of our team is focused on contributing in different ways to this goal:

- **Jhon Mhar** is focused on creating a free online learning platform for underserved communities.
- **Jhon Lheo** works on educational content that can help teachers in rural areas integrate digital resources into their classrooms.
- **Rhovic** is committed to developing professional development programs to improve teaching methods and ensure quality education for all.

Together, we are passionate about using technology to foster a more equitable and accessible education system.
